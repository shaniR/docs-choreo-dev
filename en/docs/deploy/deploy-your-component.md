# Deploy Your Component

Deploying your component on Choreo makes it invocable. Once you have designed, tested, and committed the REST API, you can deploy it.

To deploy a component, follow the steps below:

1. Click the **Deploy** icon. Then in the **Build Area** card, click **Deploy**.

    ![Deploy component](../assets/img/tutorials/rest-api/deploy-api.png){.cInlineImage-full}

2. You can view the progress of the deployment from the console.

    ![Deployment progress](../assets/img/tutorials/rest-api/deployment-progress.png){.cInlineImage-full}

Once you deploy the component, the **Development** card indicates that it is active.

![Deployed component](../assets/img/tutorials/rest-api/deployed-api.png){.cInlineImage-full}

Now you can test your deployed component to check if it is working as expected.
