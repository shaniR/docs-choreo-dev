# Anonymous Access

Choreo supports anonymous access to allow (evaluation) users to try out Choreo without having to sign in. An anonymous account is valid for seven days from the time of initial access. 

!!! info
    - Anonymous access is solely for evaluation purposes and is not recommended for production use. 
    - An anonymous account expires after seven days from initial access. Therefore, we do not recommend anonymous access to Choreo on a shared computer as shared computers could posess risks such as leakage of code, credentials, and confidential information.

Because Choreo discards all data of anonymous user accounts after seven days, you can [sign in to Choreo using Google or GitHub](https://console.choreo.dev/login) to get all your data transferred to the new user account. 
Once you sign in, you can continue using Choreo with your current services, integrations, and other data.
