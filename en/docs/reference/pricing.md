# Pricing

## Introduction

Choreo is a Digital Platform as a Service that helps you develop integration solutions faster by reducing the coding effort with a low-code development platform. 

The pricing for your Choreo deployment is mainly determined based on the following: 

- **The number of components** 

    You can deploy up to five free components ((i.e., any combination of component types), and pay for each additional component.

- **Infrastructure cost**

    The infrastructure cost consists of the charges to Choreo by the cloud platform for vCPU, RAM, storage, ingress, egress, and network. Choreo provides $100 worth of infrastructure free of charge to each organization.

    If the infrastructure cost of an organization on the Free plan exceeds $100, Choreo will limit some of the services it provides to it (e.g., some components might be deactivated).

    If the infrastructure cost of an organization on the Pay As You Go plan exceeds $100, it can pay the additional infrastructure charges to the cloud platform vendor.

    If the infrastructure cost of an organization on the Enterprise plan exceeds $100, it can pay the additional infrastructure charges to the Choreo Sales Team.


## Plans

Choreo currently supports the following payment plans:

**Free**

The free tier allows you to create up to five free components. These five components can be any combination of component types.

Choreo allocates up to a maximum of 2x vCPUs and 4 GB RAM infrastructure resources to your component workloads.

You can enjoy the free tier with limitations and then move on to the Pay-As-You-Go plan if you want to create over five components.


**Pay As You Go**

This plan requires you to pay the following:
- $150 per component (except for the first five components) on a monthly basis.
- Any additional infrastructure costs incurred (i.e., if the infrastructure cost is over $100). 

This plan does not require you to pay an annual fee. You can create up to 30 components (i.e., any combination of component types). 

If the number of components you need to create exceeds 25 or if your annual spend exceeds $50,000, we recommend that you change your pricing plan to Enterprise.


**Enterprise** 

This plan allows you to pay an annual subscription of $50,000 or more (as agreed) and create up to 50 components (i.e., any combination of component types). If you need to create over 50 components, contact the Choreo sales team.

The following table summarizes the cost of each plan:

 |                      | **Free**       | **Pay As You Go** | **Enterprise** |
 |----------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
