# cURL

Choreo allows you to test your APIs using the integrated OpenAPI Console, the generated cURL command, or by integrating Postman to Choreo. Once you have created an API and deployed it, it is ready to be tested. 

You can follow the steps below to test your REST API using the Choreo-generated cURL command :

# Test your REST API

!!! note
    If you are on the **Deployment** tab, click **Test** in the **Development** card and continue from step 4 onwards. 

1. Sign in to the Choreo Console at [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/).

2. From the components list, find the API component you want to test and click it. 

3. To open the test view, click the **Test** on the left navigation menu and then click **cURL**.

4. Select the method, and configure the parameters, headers, and body required to invoke the API method selected.

6. Copy the cURL command generated under **Command**.

You can use this copied cURL command and test the API method on a cURL client.

Congratulations! You have now successfully created and tested a REST API in Choreo!
